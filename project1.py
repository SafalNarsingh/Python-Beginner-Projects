# Game of dice 
'''
    No. of players 2 - 4
    Dice numbers from 1 to 6
    
    Basic Rules:
        1. Each player will have their turn to roll the dice
        2. The current player will roll the dice
        3. The system will ask the player for further roll
            If yes, then the dice rolls and adds the score 
            and if the dice is 1 then the turn is over and the score becomes 0
            If not, then for this round the turn for the player is over, and has to wait for another round
        4. The total score of each player is counted and then the highest score wins

    Have Fun!!!
